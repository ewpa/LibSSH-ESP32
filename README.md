ESP32 SSH client/server on Arduino
==================================

This is a port of the excellent libssh.org library to an Arduino library for
the ESP32 microcontroller and its variants.

It lets you run an SSH server, SSH client, and SCP client on your ESP32 and
use it over WiFi and Ethernet.  Examples are provided for each of these
functions, as well as an over the air (OTA) flashing example.

To use, write your code and add the following include and initialization lines
to your sketch:

    #include "libssh_esp32.h"
    libssh_begin();

This library is currently built and tested against version 2.0.17 and 3.0.5 of
the ESP32 Arduino core for ESP32, ESP32-C3, ESP32-S2, and ESP32-S3 boards.
It has also been built and tested using Arduino as a component of the ESP-IDF.
Versions and boards outside of this list may function but have not been tested.
In particular, ESP32-C2/ESP8684 experiences memory allocation shortages.
Please refer to the GIT log for the latest changes.  Further information on
this port can be found at the following address.

For improved stability under any concurrency it is recommended to use the
ESP32 Arduino framework compiled with the CONFIG_MBEDTLS_HARDWARE_SHA setting
disabled in the sdkconfig.

This port created by Ewan Parker on 18th April 2020.
Last ported 28th September 2024, built with libssh commit 854795c6, branch
-stable-0.11, version libssh-0.11.1.

 The SSH library

# Why?

Why not ? :) I've began to work on my own implementation of the ssh protocol
because i didn't like the currently public ones.
Not any allowed you to import and use the functions as a powerful library,
and so i worked on a library-based SSH implementation which was non-existing
in the free and open source software world.
